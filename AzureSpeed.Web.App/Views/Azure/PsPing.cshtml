                The major drawback of this web based Azure speed test tool is that this tool does not measure latency with ICMP ping or TCP ping, due to browser limitation.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to measure ICMP ping latency to Azure data centers, you might want to check a great tool called PsPing from PsTools suite. PsPing is a command-line utility for measuring network performance, it implements Ping functionality, TCP ping, latency and bandwidth measurement. For the context of this toturial, let’s focus on the latency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is how to run your network latency test using PsPing tool:
                <ol>
                    <li>Download PsTools from <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896649.aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896649.aspx</a></li>
                    <li>
                        Extract the whole package, open a command prompt and run the following command
                        <pre>psping target:port</pre>
                        The target can be ip or dns name of VM, Storage, SQL Database and other public endpoint
                    </li>
                </ol>
                At the end, you will see an output similar to the one below (here I am using a storage endpoint and port 80 as target), with latency results (in milliseconds)

            <ul>
                <li>Azure blocks external ICMP protocol so general ping.exe which uses ICMP protocol does not work. PsPing test connectivity to a specific TCP port directly which is not blocked</li>
                <li>You can learn the meaning of each parameter of psping in the web page where you downloaded the tool</li>
